# microprofile-rest-client

This project contains 2 Microservices that communicates between each other via MicroProfile specs.

Currently WildFly Swarm 2018.2.0 implements these specs.

Just use `mvn package` to generate Uber Jars and then run them using `java -jar game-swarm.jar` and `java -jar user-swarm.jar`

You can create units tests in the interfaces package.
